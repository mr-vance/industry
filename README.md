![insdustry](readme.png)

## Description
Industry is a web-based game where players combine raw materials to create products.

## Navigation
- **HomePage**: Contains credits, help, and start buttons.
- **GamePages**: Where the gameplay takes place.

## Features
- On game start, there's a grid with images of the raw materials.

## Objective
The player's goal is to select the correct raw materials from the grid by clicking on them one by one. After selecting what they believe is the right combination, they must hit the "done" button below the grid. The game validates if the items chosen are the correct combination for the level. If correct, the player wins and proceeds to the next level. Each level features a different product to manufacture.

## Rules
- The game consists of 3 levels.
- Each level is timed:
  - Level 1: 15 seconds
  - Level 2: 10 seconds
  - Level 3: 7 seconds
- The player starts with 3 lives in each level.
- Incorrectly selecting a raw material deducts a life.
- Losing all lives results in a game over.
- Running out of time also results in a game over.
